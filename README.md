## General Information
- Loan dataset for the time period 2007 to 2011
- Buisness problem
    A consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicantâ€™s profile.
    If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
    If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

## Conclusions
    - 1.B grade employeed takes more loans, results in more defaulters, so B grade is more likely to be defaulters
    - 2.More the interest rate, its more likely to cause defaulting.
    - 3.Customers who pays mortgage pays higher interest, so mortgage payers are more likely to be defaulters
    - 4.When experience of employee increases, salary of the customer increases,which increases the chances of full payback
    - 5.Customers with public records and bankruptcies are most likely to be defaulters
    - 6.The number of loans issued is more in the last quarter, compared to any other quarter, this might be because the 
         lending club might have deadline to achieve at the year end, so the last quarter is more prone to defaulters
    - 7.Similaryly, our contingency heatmap in derived metrics says that there more number of defaulters in the last quarter, Therefore,  the loans lended in the last quarter has the highest possibility of defaulters.
    - 8.dti is more for A,B,C grade employees, which leads to more interest, which more likely cause defaulting
